# Candidate Profile Dashboard (Pro UI v2)

**What’s new**
- Settings that actually **apply live** (fonts, sizes, colors, gradients, background, card transparency).
- **Compact mosaic layout** (2–3 columns) to **reduce scrolling**; timeline auto-hides in compact to save space.
- KPI numbers larger with shorter labels + tooltips.
- Personal/Projects Q→A rows skip empty values, improving scanability.
- Experience redesign: **role+tenure left, organization right**, elided when long.
- Publications emphasis with large numeric stat tiles; hides pie when skewed.
- Education cards hide empty rank rows; responsive grid.
- End-of-page **Insight & Analysis** with heuristic score and **Export to PDF** (PyMuPDF).
